**This is a work in progress! Some things are definitely broken.**

Some things that don't really work right now:
- Multi stop trips
- The UI in general (although recently improved!)

This web app is designed to be easy to use - just a single file to download that's ready to go.

## Usage
1) Download `index.html` and open it up in your chosen web browser
2) Upload your archive with the takeout data (everything stays local and is processed on your device)
3) Voila! Take a look at all your trips!
